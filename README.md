ðŸŒ¸ Iris Dataset Description
The Iris Dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936. The dataset is often used as a beginnerâ€™s dataset for classification and pattern recognition.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Summary:
Number of Instances (rows): 150

Number of Features (columns): 4 numerical features + 1 categorical target

Number of Classes: 3 (species of Iris flowers)

ðŸŒ¿ Features (All numerical - in centimeters):
Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

ðŸŒ¸ Target Variable (Species):
Iris-setosa

Iris-versicolor

Iris-virginica

Each species has 50 samples, and the dataset is balanced. The goal is to classify the species of a flower based on the measurements of its petals and sepals.

ðŸŽ¯ Applications:
Supervised learning (classification)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Data visualization

Feature scaling and dimensionality reduction
